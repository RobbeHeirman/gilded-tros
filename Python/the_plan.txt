1) design choice items -> nothing has been said about extending it with a child class (Sorry for being that guy QA.)
   will offload qualityUpdate responsibilities to the items themselves.
    choice:
        -> smart use of polymorphism + factory pattern?
        -> inject a quality update function?
    chosen:
        -> inheritance and virtual update_quality so i can check my boundaries => use factory pattern.

2) Write down what has to be tested.
    -> DONE

3) define additional function class skeletons.
    -> DONE
4) write tests and tests and some more tests.
3) Write some code! (heavy breathing)
4) profit?
